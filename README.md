GM Class 2 VPW network arduino based sniffer. This sniffer is based on some of the code supplied by someone named Thaniel. The base of the code was forked from https://github.com/LegacyNsfw/ArduinoVpw/tree/main/Mega2560. Dale Follett of Twisted Builds LLC has changed the code to the bare bones needed to actually get data from a GM Class 2 VPW network. This sniffer is not coded to transmit anything, it is for receiving messages only.

The vpw_message_notes.ino file has a commented out section that are known PID ID's.
